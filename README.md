# Visual Studio Code - Development Container - PostgreSQL

This project provides a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for PostgreSQL. This container contains all the tools needed to debug PostgreSQL and a PostgreSQL build that is compiled without optimizations, enabled assertions, and debug symbols. This PostgreSQL build is slower than a production build but allows it to develop and test PostgreSQL extensions. For instance, the build performs checks to catch programming mistakes due to the enabled assertions (`USE_ASSERT_CHECKING`) and cleaning freed memory early (`CLOBBER_FREED_MEMORY`). The created debug symbols and the missing optimizations make it easy to attach a debugger to this instance.

## Prerequisites

To use the development container, the following prerequisites have to be met:

* VSCode is [installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* Docker is [installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial#_install-docker)
* The VSCode _Dev Containers_ extension is [installed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Open the Project

After the prerequisites are met, the VSCode project can be opened. After loading the project, VSCode asks if the project should be `Reopened in Container`; this option should be selected.

Afterward, VSCode downloads the needed base container image, installs the tools, and compiles PostgreSQL. This step might _need some time_ to complete. Details about the build process are shown by clicking on the `show log` link.

## First Start

After the container is built, the PostgreSQL source code that is part of the development container should be added to VSCode. This allows you to browse the source code and perform full-text search from VSCode as well. To import the source code, a new terminal should be opened and the following command should be executed:

```
code --add /usr/local/src/postgresql
```

_Note:_ VSCode might need to reload the window after executing the command.

For example, you can search for the PostgreSQL function `add_path()` after the header files (`.h`) of the source code is added to VSCode, and you should find some matches.

### Connecting to the PostgreSQL server

The development container automatically starts the PostgreSQL server when the container is executed. Using the integrated terminal, you can connect to this PostgreSQL server after you have created a database using `createdb`. For example, the following commands create a database, connect to the database, create a table, perform a `SELECT` statement, and delete the database.

```
createdb test
psql test
CREATE TABLE test (id INTEGER);
SELECT * FROM test;
\q
dropdb test
```

### Installing an Extension

The container also contains a simple `hello_world` PostgreSQL extension, which provides the function `hello_world(TEXT)`. The function takes a parameter of the type `TEXT` and returns `Hello %PARAMETER` also as a `TEXT`. The source code of the extension can be found in the `src/extension/01_hello_world/` directory.

To install and test the extension, you need to change to the directory of the extension. Afterward, you can compile it by running `make`. This builds the library `hello_world.so`. By running `sudo make install`, the library is copied into the `lib` folder of the database server, and helper files are copied into the `extensions` directory of PostgreSQL. The command must be prefixed with `sudo` since only root has write permissions on these directories. After the extension is installed it can be tested. By running `make installcheck` a new database is created and, the test statements of the file `test/sql/00_hello.sql` are executed and the results are compared with the output stored in `test/expected/00_hello.out`.

```
cd src/extensions/01_hello_world/
make
sudo make install
make installcheck
```

The extension can be also tested interactively. To use the extension, a new database needs to be created first:

```
createdb test
psql test
```

Afterward, the extension should be available for installation. This can be verified by the following command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;

         name | default_version | installed_version |                      comment                       
--------------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------
 postgres_fdw |             1.1 |                   | foreign-data wrapper for remote PostgreSQL servers
 plpgsql      |             1.0 |               1.0 | PL/pgSQL procedural language
 hello_world  |             1.0 |                   | Simple hello world extension
(3 rows)
```

It shows that the extensions `postgres_fdw`, `plpgsql`, and `hello_world` are known by the database server.

By executing:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION hello_world;
```

the extension can be installed in the current database. By executing `\dx` (a helper command provided by `psql`), the installed extensions are listed:

```
\dx
 List of installed extensions
   Name      | Version |   Schema   |         Description          
-------------+---------+------------+------------------------------
 hello_world | 1.0     | public     | Simple hello world extension
 plpgsql     | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
(2 rows)
```

During the installation, the content of the install script of the extension `hello_world--1.0.sql` is executed. The script registers a new function in the database catalog and defines the entry point in the C code. In other words, the function is known at the SQL level afterward and PostgreSQL knows that it should call the implementation in our extension. By running the helper command `\df+ hello_world` the information about the function can be retrieved from the catalog.

```sql
\df+ hello_world

 Schema |    Name | Result data type | Argument data types | Type | Volatility | Parallel | Owner | Security | Access privileges | Language | Internal name | Description 
--------+-------------+------------------+---------------------+------+------------+----------+--------+----------+-------------------+----------+---------------+-------------
 public | hello_world | text | text | func | volatile   | unsafe | vscode | invoker  |                   | c        | hello_world   | 
```

The function can now be called:

```sql
SELECT hello_world('Mr X');

 hello_world 
-------------
 Hello Mr X
(1 row)
```

### Using a Debugger
To debug the extension, the source code `hello_world.c` needs to be opened. Afterward, a breakpoint can be set by clicking on the dot right of the line number.

![Set a breakpoint](./docs/images/set_breakpoint.png)

To stop the execution at this point, open a new connection to the database server by running `psql test` from the terminal.

Afterward, click on the editor and press `F5`. A drop-down menu is shown, which asks to which process the debugger should connect. Type `test` and you should see two PostgreSQL processes containing the name of the `test` database. One process is the `psql` client, the other process is the actual PostgreSQL server backend. It is named `postgresql: vscode test [local] idle`. `vscode` is the user that is connected to the database, `test` is the database name, `[local]` is the name of the client host, and `idle` is the transaction status of this backend. This process should be selected from the drop-down list. Afterward the debugger attaches to this process.

![Set a breakpoint](./docs/images/attach_debugger.png)

Afterward, execute the command `SELECT hello_world('Mr X');` again from your terminal (there might be multiple terminals now, one for the debugger and your terminal executing `psql`. Make sure you select the right one from the list on the right in the terminal tab).

After the command is executed, the debugger stops at the breakpoint. On the left pane, you see the actual values of the `Locals` (the variables that are visible in the scope). In addition, the call stack is shown below, and you can switch between the frames on the call stack. On the top, you find some new buttons that allow you to continue the execution or perform an execution line by line or enter the called functions and execute them line by line.

![Execute the Debugger](./docs/images/execute_debugger.png)


_Note:_ You can also switch to the implementation of the used functions by pressing `F12`. For example, click on the function `text_to_cstring()` and press `F12` afterward. The file `varlena.c` of the PostgreSQL source code is opened in a new tab, and the cursor is moved to the function definition.
