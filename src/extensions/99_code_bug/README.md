# Extension with a Bug

This directory contains a extension that defines the function `check_bms_membership`. Unfortunately, this function contains a bug.

### Current result

The `make installcheck` command is failing.

```
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ make installcheck
[...]
# +++ regress install-check in  +++
# using postmaster on Unix socket, default port
not ok 1     - 00_bms_member                               3 ms

### Expected result
The `make installcheck` command should pass. 

_Note:_ The bug is in the program logic, the test specification is correct.

```
$ make installcheck
[...]
# +++ regress install-check in  +++
# using postmaster on Unix socket, default port
ok 1         - 00_bms_member                                3 ms

# All 1 tests passed.
```

### Your task
Your task is to understand what the `check_bms_membership` function of the extension is supposed to do, find the bug, and fix it. In addition, you should be able to explain why the problem happens with larger values and all smaller values work properly.
